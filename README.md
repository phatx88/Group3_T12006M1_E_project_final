AskMeMobile is a Aptech E-project that we started doing in September, 2020.
The goal was to build a mobile informational website that contain and categorize mobile phones information according to brand and product features.
The website must be able to categorize and provide tabular comparison information of at least 5 phone models of the same brand and 2 of different brands.
A brief summary of phone features should be displayed and a link to download full-specs documents for internet users if they wish to download these doc files into their local machine. 
The website should be 100% responsive to all mobile devices, the site overall color should be soothing and more of pastel colors to be ultilized.

This project was built from scratch using HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap 4 framework. The website was designed and built by members of group 3, class T1-2006-M1, Semester 1, Aptech Computer Education HCM Center.
Our team members include: Luong Xuan Phat ( team lead), Pham Trong Nghia (web developer), Le Nguyen Trieu (web developer).
